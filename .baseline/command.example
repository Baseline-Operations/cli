# Baseline Command Name Configuration
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure the baseline command name.
# To use a custom command name:
#
# 1. Copy this file to 'command' (without .example) in your workspace root:
#    cp packages/cli/.baseline/command.example .baseline/command
#
# 2. Edit .baseline/command and set your desired command name:
#    echo "mybaseline" > .baseline/command
#
# 3. The command name is automatically loaded when you run baseline commands.
#
# Alternatively, set the BASELINE_COMMAND environment variable:
#    export BASELINE_COMMAND=mybaseline
#
# Priority order:
# 1. BASELINE_COMMAND environment variable
# 2. .baseline/command file (git-ignored)
# 3. Default: "bl"
#
# Note: .baseline/command is git-ignored, so it won't be committed to your repository.
# Each developer can have their own command name preference.
